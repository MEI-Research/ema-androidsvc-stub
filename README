# Stub EMA Android Service

This is a stub re-implementation of the `ema-ti-8-android-module` "ti.myservice" 
Titanium native module API.  

All it does is start a foreground service in the same manner as the real service.
All of the notification methods do nothing.

## Building

Simply run `cd android; ti build -p android --build-only` which will compile and package your module.
